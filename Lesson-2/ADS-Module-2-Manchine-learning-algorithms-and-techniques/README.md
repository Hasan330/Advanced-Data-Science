# Introduction to machine learning
During this session we will start introducing machine learning concepts, through the session we will introduce theory behind statical learning methods. The session will take participants through the conceptual and applied foundations of machine learning. Topics covered include: 
* What is supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcment learning. 
* Introduce the theory behind linear and logistic regression
* Practice and apply theory by implementing two projects (linear, logistic) learning models in R.
